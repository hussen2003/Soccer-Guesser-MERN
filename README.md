A game that is a "modified" version of the known game: WORDLE. The twist, is that it is about soccer players. 
We have a databse of famous soccer players and it will randomly pick one every 24hours and the user will see the same format as when they play WORDLE: empty boxes representing the number of letters in their name, a pop-out keyboard, and they have to start guessing who they think the player is.
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
If a box turns green: that letter is exactly in the right spot. 
If a box turns yellow: that letter exists in the name, but the user did not guess it in the exact correct spot. 
If a box stays gray/black: that letter is NOT in the name.

The user will have 5 guesses, and there will be a Leaderboard afterwards with stats.
